# Friendship And Tea Ceremony

Welcome to the "Friendship And Tea Ceremony" folder of the Tomodachi Starlit Bonds Academy GitHub repository! This folder is dedicated to exploring the relationship between friendship and the traditional Japanese tea ceremony, known as "chanoyu" or "sado."

## About Friendship And Tea Ceremony

The Japanese tea ceremony is not just a ritual for preparing and drinking tea but also a profound cultural practice that embodies principles of harmony, respect, purity, and tranquility. Central to the tea ceremony is the concept of "wa," or harmony, which emphasizes the importance of fostering meaningful connections and friendships through shared experiences.
