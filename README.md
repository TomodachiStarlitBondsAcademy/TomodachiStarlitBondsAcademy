## ⚡ Fun fact:
In the Edo period (1603-1868), the concept of friendship was deeply intertwined with the values of loyalty, honor, and mutual assistance. The term "友" (tomo) denotes a friend, but it also implies a companion with whom one shares a journey, both literally and metaphorically. The traditions and stories from this era provide a rich tapestry of how friendships were formed and maintained, often reflected in art, literature, and social practices of the time.
