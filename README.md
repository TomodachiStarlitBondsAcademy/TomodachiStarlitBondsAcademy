### Discover the Essence of Friendship in Japanese Culture
In Japanese culture, friendship is not just a simple bond between individuals. It is a profound connection rooted in mutual respect, loyalty, and shared experiences.

The Edo period (1603-1868) was a time of peace, prosperity, and cultural blossoming in Japan. During this era, the values of camaraderie and mutual respect were deeply ingrained in the fabric of society. The hierarchical yet communal structure of Edo society emphasized the importance of harmonious relationships, whether among samurai, merchants, artisans, or farmers.
