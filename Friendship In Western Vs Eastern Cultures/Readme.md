## About Friendship In Western Vs Eastern Cultures

Friendship is a universal human experience, yet the ways in which it is understood, expressed, and valued can vary significantly across different cultures. By examining the cultural norms, social structures, and relational dynamics of friendship in Western and Eastern cultures, we can gain insights into the diversity of human relationships and the cultural contexts that shape them.
