## Understanding the JLPT

The JLPT was first administered in 1984 and has since become a widely recognized qualification for Japanese language learners. The test evaluates language proficiency through various sections, including vocabulary, grammar, reading, and listening. Each level of the JLPT corresponds to a specific degree of language ability:

- **N5:** Basic understanding of Japanese, equivalent to the ability to read and understand typical expressions and sentences written in hiragana, katakana, and basic kanji.
- **N4:** Basic ability to understand Japanese used in everyday situations.
- **N3:** Ability to understand Japanese used in everyday situations to a certain degree.
- **N2:** Ability to understand Japanese used in everyday situations, as well as in a variety of circumstances to a certain degree.
- **N1:** Ability to understand Japanese used in a variety of circumstances.

## Test Structure

Each JLPT level consists of different sections, which are generally divided into the following categories:

### Vocabulary (文字・語彙)

- **Kanji:** Recognition and reading of kanji characters.
- **Vocabulary:** Understanding of words and phrases in context.

### Grammar (文法) and Reading (読解)

- **Grammar:** Understanding of grammatical structures and their correct usage.
