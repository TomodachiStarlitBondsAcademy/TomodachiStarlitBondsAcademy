(Verse 1)
Through the sands of time, we journey on,
As eternal companions, our bond forever strong.
In the tapestry of fate, our threads entwine,
Together we'll weather every storm, come rain or shine.

(Chorus)
Eternal companions, in life's grand design,
Through every trial, our souls align.
With every step we take, our spirits soar,
Eternal companions, forevermore.

(Verse 2)
In the echoes of our laughter, in the silence of our tears,
We'll walk this path together, conquering our fears.
With every sunrise we greet, with every sunset we see,
Our friendship shines eternal, through eternity.

(Chorus)
Eternal companions, in life's grand design,
Through every trial, our souls align.
With every step we take, our spirits soar,
Eternal companions, forevermore.

(Bridge)
In the tapestry of memories, our stories intertwine,
A testament to the bond we share, a love so divine.
With every heartbeat, with every breath we breathe,
We'll cherish each moment, forever to believe.

(Chorus)
Eternal companions, in life's grand design,
Through every trial, our souls align.
With every step we take, our spirits soar,
Eternal companions, forevermore.

(Outro)
As the stars light up the sky, in the silence of the night,
We'll stand together, our friendship burning bright.
For in each other's arms, in each other's hearts,
We'll remain eternal companions, never to depart.
