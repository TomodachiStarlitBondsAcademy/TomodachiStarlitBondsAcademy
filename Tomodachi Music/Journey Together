(Verse 1)
On this journey we embark, hand in hand we'll roam,
Through valleys deep and mountains high, we'll find our way back home.
With every step we take, with every path we tread,
Together we'll weather every storm, our bond never misled.

(Chorus)
We'll journey together, through sunshine and rain,
Through laughter and tears, our friendship will remain.
With each passing day, our love will grow,
As we walk side by side, our spirits aglow.

(Verse 2)
In the tapestry of life, where dreams take flight,
We'll chase our hopes and dreams, under the starry night.
With every obstacle we face, with every challenge we meet,
Together we'll conquer the odds, our journey complete.

(Chorus)
We'll journey together, through sunshine and rain,
Through laughter and tears, our friendship will remain.
With each passing day, our love will grow,
As we walk side by side, our spirits aglow.

(Bridge)
In the rhythm of the world, where time flows free,
We'll dance to the beat of life, you and me.
With every song we sing, with every story we tell,
Our journey together, a tale to retell.

(Chorus)
We'll journey together, through sunshine and rain,
Through laughter and tears, our friendship will remain.
With each passing day, our love will grow,
As we walk side by side, our spirits aglow.

(Outro)
On this journey we embark, hand in hand we'll roam,
Through valleys deep and mountains high, we'll find our way back home.
With every step we take, with every path we tread,
Together we'll weather every storm, our bond never misled.
