(Verse 1)
In the silence of the night, where dreams take flight,
Our hearts beat as one, in the soft moonlight.
Through every trial we face, through every joy we share,
Our harmony of hearts, a melody rare.

(Chorus)
Harmony of hearts, a symphony divine,
In perfect rhythm, our souls entwine.
Through the echoes of time, our love imparts,
In the dance of life, our harmony of hearts.

(Verse 2)
In the tapestry of dreams, where hopes arise,
We walk hand in hand, under starlit skies.
With every step we take, with every breath we breathe,
Our harmony of hearts, a bond that won't leave.

(Chorus)
Harmony of hearts, a symphony divine,
In perfect rhythm, our souls entwine.
Through the echoes of time, our love imparts,
In the dance of life, our harmony of hearts.

(Bridge)
In the chaos of the world, where shadows dwell,
Our love shines bright, like a guiding spell.
With every laugh we share, with every tear we cry,
Our harmony of hearts, will never say goodbye.

(Chorus)
Harmony of hearts, a symphony divine,
In perfect rhythm, our souls entwine.
Through the echoes of time, our love imparts,
In the dance of life, our harmony of hearts.

(Outro)
In the silence of the night, where dreams take flight,
Our hearts beat as one, in the soft moonlight.
Through every trial we face, through every joy we share,
Our harmony of hearts, a melody rare.
