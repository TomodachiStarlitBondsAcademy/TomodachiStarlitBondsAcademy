(Verse 1)
In the symphony of life, we play our part,
Forever friends, from the very start.
With laughter in our hearts, and joy in our eyes,
We'll write our story, under azure skies.

(Chorus)
Forever friends overture, in harmony we'll sing,
With every note, our friendship will bring.
With every chord, our bond will grow,
Forever friends, in the ebb and flow.

(Verse 2)
In the chapters of our journey, we'll turn the page,
Forever friends, from age to age.
With memories as our guide, and dreams as our wings,
We'll soar together, as the chorus sings.

(Chorus)
Forever friends overture, in harmony we'll sing,
With every note, our friendship will bring.
With every chord, our bond will grow,
Forever friends, in the ebb and flow.

(Bridge)
In the tapestry of time, our colors blend,
Forever friends, until the end.
With every heartbeat, with every sigh,
We'll cherish each other, under starlit sky.

(Chorus)
Forever friends overture, in harmony we'll sing,
With every note, our friendship will bring.
With every chord, our bond will grow,
Forever friends, in the ebb and flow.

(Outro)
In the symphony of life, we play our part,
Forever friends, from the very start.
With laughter in our hearts, and joy in our eyes,
We'll write our story, under azure skies.
