(Verse 1)
In the face of adversity, we stand as one,
True allies, until the battle's won.
With courage in our hearts, and strength in our soul,
We'll face the challenges ahead, together we'll grow.

(Chorus)
True allies anthem, in solidarity we rise,
With unity as our shield, we'll reach for the skies.
With every victory, our bond will strengthen,
True allies, our anthem lengthen.

(Verse 2)
In the shadows of doubt, we'll cast our light,
True allies, through the darkest night.
With trust in each other, and hope in our eyes,
We'll march forward hand in hand, under azure skies.

(Chorus)
True allies anthem, in solidarity we rise,
With unity as our shield, we'll reach for the skies.
With every victory, our bond will strengthen,
True allies, our anthem lengthen.

(Bridge)
In the tapestry of history, our story unfolds,
True allies, in the legends told.
With every step we take, with every battle won,
We'll stand together, until the setting sun.

(Chorus)
True allies anthem, in solidarity we rise,
With unity as our shield, we'll reach for the skies.
With every victory, our bond will strengthen,
True allies, our anthem lengthen.

(Outro)
In the face of adversity, we stand as one,
True allies, until the battle's won.
With courage in our hearts, and strength in our soul,
We'll face the challenges ahead, together we'll grow.
