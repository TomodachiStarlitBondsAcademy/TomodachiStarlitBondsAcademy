(Verse 1)
In the brotherhood of souls, we find our way,
Bound by love, come what may.
With loyalty in our hearts, and honor in our deed,
We'll walk this path together, our brotherhood decreed.

(Chorus)
Brotherhood ballad, in unity we stand,
With every handshake, and every hand.
With every pledge, our spirits rise,
Brotherhood ballad, under azure skies.

(Verse 2)
In the tapestry of time, our stories intertwine,
A testament to the bond we share, a love so divine.
With every laugh we share, with every tear we cry,
Our brotherhood grows stronger, reaching for the sky.

(Chorus)
Brotherhood ballad, in unity we stand,
With every handshake, and every hand.
With every pledge, our spirits rise,
Brotherhood ballad, under azure skies.

(Bridge)
In the symphony of friendship, our voices rise,
Brotherhood ballad, under sunlit skies.
With every harmony, with every chord we play,
We'll sing together, come what may.

(Chorus)
Brotherhood ballad, in unity we stand,
With every handshake, and every hand.
With every pledge, our spirits rise,
Brotherhood ballad, under azure skies.

(Outro)
In the brotherhood of souls, we find our way,
Bound by love, come what may.
With loyalty in our hearts, and honor in our deed,
We'll walk this path together, our brotherhood decreed.
