(Verse 1)
In the rhythm of life, we find our stride,
Inseparable rhythms, side by side.
With every beat, our hearts entwine,
Inseparable rhythms, yours and mine.

(Chorus)
Inseparable rhythms, through every beat we find,
In the dance of life, our souls align.
With every step, our spirits soar,
Inseparable rhythms, forevermore.

(Verse 2)
In the melody of time, where dreams unfold,
Inseparable rhythms, stories yet untold.
With every note, our voices blend,
Inseparable rhythms, until the end.

(Chorus)
Inseparable rhythms, through every beat we find,
In the dance of life, our souls align.
With every step, our spirits soar,
Inseparable rhythms, forevermore.

(Bridge)
In the symphony of friendship, our voices rise,
Inseparable rhythms, under sunlit skies.
With every harmony, with every chord we play,
We'll dance together, come what may.

(Chorus)
Inseparable rhythms, through every beat we find,
In the dance of life, our souls align.
With every step, our spirits soar,
Inseparable rhythms, forevermore.

(Outro)
In the rhythm of life, we find our stride,
Inseparable rhythms, side by side.
With every beat, our hearts entwine,
Inseparable rhythms, yours and mine.
