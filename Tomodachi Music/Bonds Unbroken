(Verse 1)
In the quiet of the night, beneath the starry skies,
Our friendship shines so bright, never questioning why.
Through the laughter and the tears, through the highs and lows,
Our bond remains unbroken, as the river flows.

(Chorus)
Bonds unbroken, hearts entwined,
Through every storm, our souls aligned.
Hand in hand, we'll face the unknown,
Forever bound, our love has shown.

(Verse 2)
In the echoes of our past, memories intertwine,
Like threads of gold, our stories enshrine.
Through every twist and turn, through every joy and pain,
Our friendship stands unyielding, through sunshine and rain.

(Chorus)
Bonds unbroken, hearts entwined,
Through every storm, our souls aligned.
Hand in hand, we'll face the unknown,
Forever bound, our love has shown.

(Bridge)
In the tapestry of time, our colors blend as one,
A masterpiece of friendship, second to none.
With every breath we take, with every step we roam,
Our bonds unbroken, lead us safely home.

(Chorus)
Bonds unbroken, hearts entwined,
Through every storm, our souls aligned.
Hand in hand, we'll face the unknown,
Forever bound, our love has shown.

(Outro)
Bonds unbroken, forevermore,
In our hearts, you'll find the door.
To a world where love has spoken,
Bonds unbroken, forever woven.
