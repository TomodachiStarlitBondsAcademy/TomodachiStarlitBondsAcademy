Community Guidelines

At Tomodachi Starlit Bonds Academy, we believe in creating a positive and inclusive community where all learners can thrive. Our Community Guidelines outline the expectations for behavior and interaction within our community.

1. Respect: We expect all members of our community to treat each other with respect and dignity, regardless of differences in background, culture, or opinions. Harassment, discrimination, or any form of hateful conduct will not be tolerated.

2. Inclusivity: We celebrate diversity and strive to create an environment where everyone feels included and valued. We encourage participation from individuals of all ages, backgrounds, and abilities.

3. Constructive Interaction: We encourage constructive dialogue and collaboration among community members. We value open-mindedness, curiosity, and a willingness to learn from others.
